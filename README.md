# A Lap Around Azure Machine Learning

Welcome to this hands-on lap around Azure Machine Learning.

The exercises in this lab are designed to help you explore the key concepts and capabilities of Azure ML in a compressed amount of time. We won't have time to dig into the details of every feature, but you should get a sense of how things fit together to enable you to manage data science and machine learning workloads in Azure.

> **Note**: You'll need an Azure subscription to complete the exercises. If you don't already have one, Microsoft employees can activate a Visual Studio benefit that includes $150 Azure credit per-month at https://visualstudio.com - just sign in with your corporate credentials and use your benefits to activate your Azure credit - you'll need to link your account to an alternate, personal Microsoft account (like an outlook.com account or similar.)

So, ready to get started?
